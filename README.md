# DeFUSE
DeFuse is a collection of classes in C++ for extracting and evaluating video-based features for similarity search. The purpose of this project arose due to my master thesis. The idea was to develop an extension of the static Feature Signatures that have been introduced for images retrieval. Several attempts and different minor projects later resulted finally in the collection of classes.
